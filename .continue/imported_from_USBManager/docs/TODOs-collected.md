# Collected TODOs (automatically generated)

Date: 2025-12-23

This file aggregates TODO mentions found in Markdown files across the repository.

NOTE: Actionable tasks have been consolidated into `docs/TODOs-actionable.md`.
Please keep ephemeral notes and research items in their original docs, and move concrete tasks into the actionable file.

## Found TODO entries

- TODO-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md: "**TODO Highlight** - Track TODOs and FIXMEs" (section: Complete TODO List & Project Status)
- server/README.md: "**Future Extensions (TODO)**" (future extension notes)
- PR_BODY.md: follow-up TODO to consider history-scrub (`git filter-repo`)
- agent/SimRacingAgent/Docs/README.md: "Service Mode: Background service (TODO: Future implementation)"

- SESSION_SUMMARY.md: "TODO list updated in workspace." (completed-note migrated 2026-01-24)
 - SESSION_SUMMARY.md: "TODO list updated in workspace." (completed-note migrated 2026-01-24)
 - HANDOFF.md: "Run isolated repro harness" (migrated from HANDOFF.md logged state; actionable: run concurrent POST repro against failure DB and capture logs/TRX)

If you need the exact line references or surrounding context, open these files:

## Recommended next steps (reorganization)

1. Action taken: `docs/TODOs-actionable.md` created (2026-01-19). Use that for scheduling and assignments.

2. Keep ephemeral notes, ideas, and future-extension bullets in the original docs, but add a short pointer to the centralized TODO file.

3. For large multi-step TODOs (e.g., "Service Mode"), create an issue in your tracker and reference it from `docs/TODOs-actionable.md`.

4. Automate scanning: add a CI job to regenerate `docs/TODOs-collected.md` weekly (or on PR) to keep the list fresh.

## High-priority considerations (as requested)

- Have a fully tested & debugged solution up and running (HIGH priority):
  - Run `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` on the solution (`Device-Sentinel.sln` / `USBDeviceManager.sln` depending on desired root).
  - Address failures in tests or startup scripts; prioritize fixes that unblock CI and local developer experience.

- Clean build and commit:
  - When tests are green, run a clean (`git clean -fdx` locally outside uncommitted work), ensure no `bin/` or `obj/` are tracked, then commit the state and push.

## Session summary files

There are multiple session summary files present (`SESSION_SUMMARY.md`, `SESSION_SUMMARY_NEXT.md`). Recommendation:

- Consolidate: keep a single canonical `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY.md` (or `docs/sessions/INDEX.md`) and move per-session details into `docs/sessions/<yyyy-mm-dd>-summary.md`.
- Rationale: avoids duplicate/conflicting summaries, provides stable index, and keeps history discoverable.
- If older session files are noisy or redundant, archive them to `docs/archives/` rather than deleting immediately.

## Next actions I can take now (pick any):

1. Run the full build and test suite, capture TRX and failing test list.
2. Create a PR that consolidates session summaries into `docs/sessions/` and moves existing summaries there (draft).
3. Start the `InputObject` rename and PyQt GUI adjustments (I can implement and run a quick smoke test).

## Added actionable code TODOs (recorded to avoid CI failures)

- server/USBDeviceManager/Pages/Automation.razor: "TODO: add rules CRUD and execution controls." — action: move into `docs/TODOs-actionable.md` or create issue linking this entry.
- server/USBDeviceManager/Controllers/DevicesController.cs: "TODO: Implement actual USB device scanning" — action: allocate to server team, or add stub + integration test.
- server/USBDeviceManager/Components/Pages/Home.razor: "TODO: Implement modal for adding software" — action: UI task; create issue and reference here.
- server/USBDeviceManager/Components/Pages/Home.razor: "TODO: Implement modal for adding automation rules" — action: UI task; create issue and reference here.
